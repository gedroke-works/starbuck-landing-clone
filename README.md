Vanilla HTML/CSS Starbuck landing page clone

This project use only HTML/CSS and Javascript. The goal here is to master fundamentals aspects of the 3 languages.
The way I made this to assure that I can reproduce the same process to build more landing pages.

Technologies used: 
  * HTML
  * CSS

Tools: 
  * Firefox Dev Tools
  * VsCode
  * Pen and Paper (the most important tool you can use to build anything).

Building process:
  * Destructuration of the page in "boxes". This dicdate how I will structure my HTML code. 
  * List up all frontend functionalities I might add in the project.
  * Start making navigation bar.
  * Now we need to think ahead and find what sections I can reuse in my code and structure my css class.
  * Making left to right sections with flexbox.
  * When I was building this, top to bottom sections was on the live website but not anymore. I kept that just to show that I can do it that way too.
  * Making the footer.
  
This process should be efficient enough to build other landing pages with HTML/CSS/Javascript.

What next ? :
  * Use media queries to make the landing page mobile friendly.
  * Clean up the code with more optimize CSS.
  * Customize the landing page, with more personal touches such as color theme, logos, photos. What about a Bubble Tea business landing page ?
